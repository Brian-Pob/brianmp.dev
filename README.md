# Personal Website

Hi! My name is Brian. I'm a Frontend Engineer currently based near Seattle, WA.
I have a genuine passion for web development and UX and this website is how I
would like to demonstrate my passion.

## What I Use

My site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build). I like how it's easy
to use while also being flexible and performant.

For my site, I'm using regular CSS/SCSS with [Open Props](https://open-props.style).
You can think of Open Props as sort of an alternative to Tailwind.
Similar to Tailwind, Open Props gives you a good-looking premade design system.
The difference is that instead of using the styles through HTML classes, you use
them through CSS custom properties.

I know [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is extremely popular nowadays but I personally enjoy writing
regular CSS for the most part (with some SASS/SCSS mixed in). I'm still
a big fan of Tailwind though and I think it's a really cool way to write
styles that are easy to maintain and extend.

## Accessibility

I am a huge proponent of accessibility. Throughout my life I have met a lot of
different people. Many of them with their own special needs and accomodations.
My older brother was diagnosed with high-functioning autism. One of my good
friends has vision problems and has difficulty reading text unless it's 2 inches
from his eyes. I can't imagine building something that someone will not be able
to use simply because they have different physical needs.

When I build something, I want it to be usable for as many people as possible.
Not just by adding alt text to images. I want my designs to be thoughtfully
crafted and carefully examinied to ensure that they adhere to (or even exceed)
modern accessibility standards. So if you are using something that I built and
find an accessibility issue with it, please do not hesitate to reach out to me
through email or socials. If the code is public, feel free to open an Issue
or make a Pull Request.

## Code of Ethics

I subscribe to the same [Code of Ethics used by SQLite](https://sqlite.org/codeofethics.html).
I believe in the Bible, the Resurrection, the Trinity,
and salvation through faith in Jesus Christ alone.

I understand that this is completely unnecessary for a personal blog website
but I wanted to put it out there so there can be no dispute that I am a
follower of Jesus Christ.
