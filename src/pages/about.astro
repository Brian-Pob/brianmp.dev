  <p>
    I am a web developer with a bachelor's degree in computer science and I am
    currently pursuing my master's in computer science. I specialize in front
    end development and I have a rich background in UX/UI Research and Design.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently I build and update React components for brands like The Gap and
    Lululemon by making their components adhere to web accessibility guidelines
    (ADA compliance). While I only recently started learning and implementing
    accessibility, it has quickly become my main focus as a developer and
    designer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Right now I am conducting user research and source code evaluation for the
    Florida Department of Transportation on behalf of Florida State University
    as a graduate research assistant. Excellent verbal and written communication
    is essential for this role and my professor, Ms. Sonia Haiduc Ph.D., can
    attest to my skills. I am great at collaborating with my team to get work
    done while also being comfortable working individually.
  </p>

  <p>
    My friends and family with special needs have inspired me to make
    accessibility the focus of my career. I am constantly teaching myself about
    best practices in accessibility. In both my work as a frontend developer as
    well as my research with FSU, I ensure that accessibility is a primary
    consideration and not an afterthought.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am a self-motivated individual with a passion for programming and design.
    I am a quick learner and readily take on any challenge presented to me.
