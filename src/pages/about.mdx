I am a **web developer** with a bachelor's degree in computer science and I am
currently pursuing my master's in computer science. I specialize in **front
end development** and I have a rich background in **UX/UI Research and Design**.

{' '}

Currently I build and update **React components** for brands like The Gap and
Lululemon by making their components adhere to web accessibility guidelines
**(ADA compliance)**. While I only recently started learning and implementing
accessibility (often abbreviated as _a11y_), it has quickly become my main focus as a developer and
designer.

{' '}

Right now I am conducting user research and source code evaluation for the
Florida Department of Transportation on behalf of Florida State University as
a graduate research assistant. Excellent verbal and written communication is
essential for this role and my professor, Ms. Sonia Haiduc Ph.D., can attest
to my skills. I am great at **collaborating** with my team to get work done while
also being comfortable working individually.

{' '}

My friends and family with special needs have inspired me to make
**accessibility** the focus of my career. I am constantly teaching myself about
best practices in accessibility. In both my work as a frontend developer as
well as my research with FSU, I ensure that accessibility is a primary
consideration and not an afterthought.

I am a self-motivated individual with a passion for programming and design.
I am a quick learner and readily take on any challenge presented to me.
