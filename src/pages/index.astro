      <h1>üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Hello, Astronaut!</h1>
      <p>
        Thank you for visiting my website. This is currently a work in progress.
        You can visit my other live website at
        <a
          href='https://brianpob.me'
          aria-label="Link to Brian's current website">brianpob.me</a
        >. Though it has not been updated in a long time. That's why I'm
        building this new one!
      </p>
      <p>
        Everything here other than this first page is placeholder content
        generated with Astro's blog template. There's really nothing to check
        out just yet. But I'm working on it!
      </p>
      <p>
        In the meantime, please check out this <a
          href='https://solid-mentor.netlify.app'
          aria-label="Link to Brian's challenge solutions">other project</a
        > I've been working on. It's a collection of my solutions to various challenges
        from Frontend Mentor built with SolidJS plus a bunch of other frameworks
        and tools. Here's a preview.
