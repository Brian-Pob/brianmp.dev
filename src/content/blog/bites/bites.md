With this post, I am introducing Bites to my blog. They're just short posts that should roughly fit in a tweet or Bluesky post or two.

Intentionally not putting a ton of thought or editing into them. Just writing what I have in mind at the moment.

Back in 2023 I started writing the Cool Stuff series. I tried to keep it really short so it would be easy for me to write.
But I ended up not sticking with it.

I still want to keep Cool Stuff around but I want it to be a bit more refined to properly showcase things that I find cool.

So for Bites, I'm gonna try to keep it as short as possible to encourage me to write.
