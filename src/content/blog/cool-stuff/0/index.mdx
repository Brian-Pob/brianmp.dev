This is my first blog post in a series I am calling "Cool Stuff."
I want this to be a series of posts where I showcase some cool things I find in the realm of tech and programming!

I want the main description of the cool thing to be under 150 words.
I think it's a good length to get the main idea across while also limiting myself from rambling on and on.
Though, since this is the first post, I'm not counting these introductory words.

Anyway, let's get on to the first cool thing: Astro!

## Astro

Astro is mainly a static site generator that allows you to build your site using a mix of HTML, JavaScript, and Markdown.
You can also add dynamic elements to your site using JavaScript (including frameworks and libraries!) through what is known as the [Islands Architecture](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/).

import heroImage from './astro-islands-example.png'

<img {...heroImage} alt="an illustration demonstrating how the islands architecture can be implemented in a layout"/>

Btw, you can mix and match multiple libraries/ frameworks too! There are even libraries that allow you to [share state between different islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/sharing-state-islands/).

Another thing I enjoy about Astro is the implementation of scoped styles.
This means that CSS that you write for one page or component won't interfered with the styles for others!
Astro implements this using clever features like [custom data attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes) and the [<code> :where</code> selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:where).

Astro has a **ton** more features that I did not mention here. So go check it out at [astro.build](https://astro.build/)!
Overall, I find it really fun and easy to use and I would highly recommend it to anyone building any kind of website.
