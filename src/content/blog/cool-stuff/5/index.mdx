## What is Omarchy?

Omarchy is a new Linux distribution built by David Heinemeier Hansson
(aka [DHH](https://dhh.dk/)),
the creator of Ruby on Rails. It is an Arch-based distro and includes a host
of pre-installed **and** pre-configured packages that aim to make programming
and general use easier.

I've been using it on my spare computer for about a month now and I'm really
enjoying it! So, here are some of my thoughts on this distro.

## Why I like Omarchy

My main gripe with most Linux distributions is that they either do too much
or do too little. Ubuntu adds too much bloat that I have no interest in using.
Vanilla Arch Linux is too barebones for me and very tedious to set up.

I've found Omarchy to be a really good sweet spot in the middle for hobby
programming and everyday computing.

### The documentation is ðŸ‘Œ

<br/>

That being said, thing I love the most about Omarchy is the documentation. Pretty much
everything you need to know about the distro -- and more importantly, how to
customize it -- is available on the official
[Omarchy manual](https://learn.omacom.io/2/the-omarchy-manual).


### Batteries included but highgly configurable

The Omarchy website itself states that the distro is [_opinionated_](https://omarchy.org/)
and that fact is quite evident. You may not like some of the packages that it
comes with or a few of the keyboard shortcuts built in.
However, the documentation makes it relatively easy to customize many aspects of
the distro to your liking.

- ***Don't want to use
[neovim](https://learn.omacom.io/2/the-omarchy-manual/62/development-tools?search=alacritty#editor)?*** Set up a different editor like [Zed](https://zed.dev/) or VS Code (or
one of the many VS Code forks).
- ***Don't like the [built-in shortcuts](https://learn.omacom.io/2/the-omarchy-manual/53/hotkeys)?*** Use your own by editing the [dotfiles](https://learn.omacom.io/2/the-omarchy-manual/65/dotfiles?search=edit#dotfiles).
- ***Want to use Kitty or Ghostty instead of Alacritty?*** Omarchy
supports them [out of the box](https://learn.omacom.io/2/the-omarchy-manual/62/development-tools?search=alacritty#terminal)!


## Final thoughts

Omarchy is a great distro and I find it a joy to use. It's definitely not for
everyone. But if you're like me and want a bit more freedom and customization
than Ubuntu but don't want to spend as much time and effort configuring
a vanilla Arch installation, then you might just find Omarchy to be a great
middle ground like it has been for me.

## Go check it out!

If you're interested in trying Omarchy out, you can install it like any Linux
distro. Just follow the [instructions](https://learn.omacom.io/2/the-omarchy-manual/50/getting-started) on the Omarchy website.
You could also
try it out in a VM if you don't want to wipe a machine to use it.
