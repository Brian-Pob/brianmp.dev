## What is `oklch()`?

`oklch()` is a color function introduced in the CSS Color 4 specification that fixes several problems present in other color functions like `rgb()` hex, and `hsl()` in addition to allowing access to more colors.

## How is it better?

First, `oklch()` colors are just easier to understand. With `oklch()`, you just need to decide how bright you want the color, how saturated you want it, and the degree on the color wheel. No more messing with hexadecimal numbers or guessing how much blue or red you need.

## Wait, that just sounds like `hsl()`.

And you would be right. But one advantage it has over `hsl()` is that the lightness of `oklch()` is based on **perceived** lightness. Meaning, when you modify your color's hue, the brightness stays the same. See the example below.

<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-default-tab="result" data-slug-hash="bGZXgjg" data-user="brian-pob" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">

Using `oklch()`, we know that changes to hue won't lead to brightness-related contrast issues!
