## 0. How CSS Borders Work

Before we get into the secret tricks, let's talk about how CSS borders work. A border is a line that surrounds an element. It can be set to different styles, colors, and widths. The border can be set to different sides of the element, or all sides at once.

The border can be set to different styles, such as `solid`, `dotted`, `dashed`, `double`, `groove`, `ridge`, `inset`, `outset`, and `none`. The border can also be set to different colors, such as `red`, `blue`, `green`, `#ff0000`, `#00ff00`, `#0000ff`, `rgb(255, 0, 0)`, `rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.5)`, and `hsl(0, 100%, 50%)`. The border can also be set to different widths, such as `1px`, `2px`, `3px`, `4px`, `5px`, `10px`, `20px`, `50px`, and `100px`.

You can also set the radius of the border to make it rounded. This is done by setting the `border-radius` property. You can set the `border-radius` to a single value, which will make all corners rounded, or you can set it to four values, which will make each corner rounded according to the value assigned.

```css
.circle {
  /* single value */
  border-radius: 10px;

  /* four values */
  border-radius: 10px 20px 30px 40px;

  /* long form */
  border-top-left-radius: 10px;
  border-top-right-radius: 20px;
  border-bottom-right-radius: 30px;
  border-bottom-left-radius: 40px;
}
```

## 1. The Circle of Life ‚≠ïÔ∏è

You can create a circle in CSS by setting the `border-radius` property to `50%`. If the element has the same height and width, this will make the element a perfect circle.

```css
.circle {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background-color: red;
}
```

For a hollow circle, you can keep the background color transparent and set a border. Changing the width and height will change the size of the circle while changing the border width will change the thickness.

```css
.hollow-circle {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  border: 10px solid blue;
  background-color: transparent; /* this can be omitted */
}
```

## 2. The Eye of the Tiger üêØ

Now that we've set the `border-radius` property to `50%`, we can create a circle. But what if we want to create an ellipse? The two main types of ellipses we can make are an oval shape with rounded ends and an ellipse with pointed ends.

For the rounded ellipse, we can still use border radius 50%, but we need to set the width and height to different values. Here are some examples of a vertical and a horizontal oval:

```css
.vertical-oval {
  width: 100px;
  height: 200px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background-color: blue;
}

.horizontal-oval {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background-color: green;
}
```

Now, for the ellipse with pointed ends, we need to use some trickery with rotation. First, we create a square, then we rotate it 45 degrees. This will make the square look like a diamond.

This is where the magic happens. We set the `border-radius` property to `50%`, **but** for only two of the corners. This will make the diamond look like an ellipse with pointed ends.

```css
.ellipse {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  transform: rotate(45deg);

  border-top-left-radius: 50%;
  border-top-right-radius: 0;
  border-bottom-right-radius: 50%;
  border-bottom-left-radius: 0;
  /* short form */
  /* border-radius: 50% 0 50% 0; */
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

We can also make a sort of "S" shape by setting different width and height values and using the same rotation and border-radius trick.

```css
.s-shape {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  transform: rotate(45deg);
  border-radius: 50% 0 50% 0;
  background-color: purple;
}
```

## 3. The Blue and Red Pill üíä

To make a pill shape, we need to set the border-radius to a really large number.
In Kevin Powell's videos, he tends to use `100vw` but you can use any large number. I usually use `1000px` but it really doesn't matter.

```css
.pill {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  border-radius: 1000px;
  background-color: pink;
}
```

## 4. It's a Trap(ezoid)! ü¶ë

To make a trapezoid, we can set the height to 0 and then add a width. Then set the `border-width` to `0 100px 100px 100px`. This will make the top and bottom borders `0`, the left border `100px`, and the right border `100px`.

```css
.trapezoid {
  width: 200px;
  height: 0;
  border-width: 0 100px 100px 100px;
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: transparent transparent red transparent;
}
```

You can manipulate the "height" of the trapezoid by changing the `border-width` values. For example, if you set the `border-width` to `0 50px 100px 50px`, you will get a trapezoid with a smaller top border.

```css
.trapezoid {
  width: 200px;
  height: 0;
  border-width: 0 50px 100px 50px;
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: transparent transparent red transparent;
}
```

Alternatively, the width of the trapezoid can be manipulated by changing the `width` value of the element. For example, if you set the `width` to `100px`, you will get a trapezoid with a smaller width.

```css
.smaller-trapezoid {
  width: 100px;
  height: 0;
  border-width: 0 50px 100px 50px;
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: transparent transparent red transparent;
}

.bigger-trapezoid {
  width: 300px;
  height: 0;
  border-width: 0 50px 100px 50px;
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: transparent transparent red transparent;
}
```

## 5. The Pyramid of Doom ‚ö†Ô∏è

Finally, we can make a triangle using a similar method to the trapezoid. We set the height to 0 but we also set the width to 0. This essentially causes the smaller end of the trapezoid to converge to a single point, making a triangle.

```css
.triangle {
  width: 0;
  height: 0;
  border-width: 0 50px 100px 50px;
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: transparent transparent red transparent;
}
```
