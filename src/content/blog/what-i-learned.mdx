## 1. Culture is not an afterthought

Culture is an integral part of working at Amazon. Amazonians take the
[Leadership Principles](https://amazon.com) seriously and don't just
wave it off as corporate lingo. These principles are embedded into the way people
work and make decisions. 

I've seen this in action in my team when [...].

## 2. "It's not my job" is not in the Amazon dictionary

Ownership is one of the Leadership Principles at Amazon. This means that the responsibility to
deliver the best for customers is on everyone. It's not just on managers or senior engineers.

In my own work, I take ownership by being proactive and always looking for ways to improve things.
This could be by suggesting new programming practices, writing and updating documentation, or
diving deep into problems to find root causes.

## 3. Writing is super important

Working at Amazon involves a lot of writing. A new document is written for pretty much everything
such as business reivews, product ideas, code changes, and sprint post-mortems.

I have learned that this is one thing that many Amazonians both old and new struggle with. Most people
just want to work on things and get stuff done. However, writing documentation allows ideas to get
fleshed out and scrutinized by others. This way, more people can give their inputs and judgments
as early on in the product lifecycle as possible. This leads into my next point.

## 4. Measure twice. Cut once. Be ready with duct tape anyway

Preparation is key at Amazon. Amazonians try their best to make work as smooth as possible by
roughing out the edges early on. This means spending time in the planning phase to think through
potential problems and solutions before jumping into execution. Measuring twice reduces the chances of mistakes and the need to redo work later on. Making changes during planning is usually cheap and fast. Making changes during execution is expensive and time consuming.

However, people also understand that unforeseen problems can arise
no matter how much time is spent in the planning phase. Therefore, Amazonians try to be ready to
adapt and pivot when necessary, oftentimes rolling back changes if needed. This
creates what is known as "two-way doors" where decisions can be reversed if needed.
