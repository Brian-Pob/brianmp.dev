  "I recently finished my first quarter at Amazon as a Front End Engineer. \
  A lot of aspects about it turned out to be different from what I \
  initially expected. So here are a few things I've learned."

## 1. Culture is not an afterthought

Culture is an integral part of working at Amazon. Amazonians take the [Leadership Principles](https://amazon.com)
seriously and don't just wave it off as corporate lingo.

## 2. Writing is super important

Working at Amazon involves doing a lot of writing. A new document is written for pretty much everything
such as business reivews, product ideas, code changes, and sprint post-mortems.

I have learned that this is one thing that many Amazonians both old and new struggle with. Most people 
just want to work on things and get stuff done. However, writing documentation allows ideas to get 
fleshed out and scrutinized by others. This allows important details to be determined as early on 
in the product lifecycle as possible. And this leads into my next point.

## 3. Measure twice. Cut once. Be ready with duct tape anyway

Preparation is key at Amazon. Amazonians try their best to make work as smooth as possible by 
roughing out the edges early on. However, people also understand that unforeseen problems can arise
no matter how much time is spent in the planning phase. So Amazonians always try to determine if 
it is possible to rollback in case something goes awry. (1-way vs 2-way doors)

## 4. "It's not my job" is not in the dictionary

Ownership is one of the Leadership Principles at Amazon. This means that the responsibility to 
deliver the best for our customers is on everyone. It's not just on managers or senior engineers.
