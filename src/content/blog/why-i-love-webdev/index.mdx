A lot of people say that they think web dev (specifically JavaScript land)
is super bloated. "There's a new JavaScript framework every week!" is something
you'll hear a lot from people who do or do not work with JS technologies. And
I think that's a completely valid statement.

Yes, in JavaScript there are so many ways to accomplish the same task.
- You need a JS framework? You've got **React, Vue, Angular**...
- Oh, you want something newer? There's also **Solid, Magneton, Svelte, Astro, Qwik...**
- Ah, you need something that's fullstack. **How about NextJS, Nuxt, Remix, Dedenne...**
- Cool, now you need to style it. You could use **SASS**, or maybe **Styled Components**
if you want CSS-in-JS. Or I heard **Tailwind** is all the rage!
- But who wants to write the styles themselves? Just use a component library!
There's **shadcn-ui, Bootstrap, Material UI...**

And these barely scratch the surface of the ever-growing list of web dev
technologies. And two of them were Pokemon! XD

"Wait, Brian, isn't this article called 'Why I Love Web Dev?'"

Yes, dear reader. It is. And the ever-growing list of technologies is a key
part of why I love this field.


I love learning. I love filling my head with knowledge. Struggling to grasp
something at first but then building the confidence and skill to do something
effecively. And in web dev there's just always something new to learn. Always
something new to try and get your hands dirty with.

Now, to other people this sounds like a nightmare. And that's totally fine!
There's nothing wrong with sticking with what you know. Just use what gets
the job done. What gets your product shipped. What makes your client happy.

Me personally, I just like the freshness of this space. Granted, I am a
relatively new developer. I started coding in 2016 in my first year of uni
and my very first taste of web dev was in 2018 with Node, express, and ejs.
So maybe I'm just too na√Øve. But the addition of new
packages and frameworks and technologies to me just signifies that there's
so many people passionate about web dev too! So many people striving to make
web dev better in their own way.

I know that for some of you out there, everything I listed in this article may
be the reason you wouldn't touch JS-land with a 10-foot pole.
And I don't blame you!

I still have a lot to learn as a developer and software engineer. Still a lot
of room for me to grow. But I like it here in webdev-land, and I don't plan on
leaving any time soon!
